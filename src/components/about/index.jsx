      <p>
        Currently in a formation at Web@academie, Epitech, I am looking for an
        apprenticeship (starting in September 2024 - 14 months).
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspiring of becoming a web developer full-stack, I began my path as
        soon as 2020 at "Université d'Orléans", before shifting to a formation
        at ENI "Ecole Informatique". For the first time, I had to be autonomous
        and self-teach coding. It was a great experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually I ended up by joining Epitech - Web@cademie where I am
        further improving my dev skills to eventually land a job in a full-stack
        position.
